the high level view of my design.

I didnt use any lbirary to do the parse. I just parse it byte by byte in java.

There are separate report in each indivual folder (parta,partb,partc). PLease check the high level view over there.


HOW TO RUN:

in each code folder, there is a text file called "how to run". You can figure out how to run over there.
