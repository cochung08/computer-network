C1:
convergence time:
1211ms
the way to calculate the convergence time:
I start counting the time  when programs in all hosts start running and stops when h1 can find the shortest path to h2 (no more updates from other nodes).


C2:
convergence time 
812 ms
the way to calculate the convergence time:
I start counting the time when i change the weight and stops when h1 can find the shortest path to h2  (no more updates from other nodes).





After running the program, you can see the routing table.

if there are three item in the record, that means two host are connected directly. If there are four items, then second item is the middle point.

For example, in part_c1_routing_table.png, for r1, it has routing table:
r1 r2 10
r1 r3 6
r1 r2 r4 6
r1 r2 h2 8

That means r1 an r2 are connected directly, with weight 10.
For record 3, r1 can forward packet to r4 via r2. The weight of shortest path from r1 to r4 is 6.
